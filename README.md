Project: Recipes for The Odin Project Curriculum

Assignment was to create a webpage (only html at this point) that will contain recipes. This project used many fundamental HTML skills, such as both types of lists, links, manually written boilerplate, images, etc. After completion I am feeling much more comfortable with these skills and am excited to move forwards to things like CSS to make things look better! During this project I even learned < div > which helped me solve those unsightly format problems after inserting an image.
