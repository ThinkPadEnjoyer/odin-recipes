    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Only 20-minutes, you'll have a delectable pasta meal suitable for the family! Can even use chicken sausage if you're looking for a different vibe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces penne pasta</li>
      <li>2 italian chicken sausages, such as Aidell's</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, finely minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>12 ounces marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add pasta, and cook until tender with a bite, 9 to 11 minutes, or according to package directions. Reserve about 1/4 cup pasta water; drain.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, slice chicken sausages in half, then slice each half into small bite-sized pieces.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and add sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
      <li>Add butter and garlic to the skillet; cook until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Add marinara sauce and cream to the skillet. Cook until combined and completely warmed through; stir in pasta. If sauce is too thick, thin with a little pasta water.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and add in as much Parmesan as you like. Serve in deep bowls with bread to scoop up the extra sauce.</li>
    </ol>
